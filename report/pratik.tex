% 2. Report Presentation (40%): % {{{


%     1. Is the format correct? IEEE two-column style format, with the font name Times
%     New Roman and size 10.

%     2. Are there obvious grammatical errors or incomplete sentences?

%     3. Are there required sections missing? Each report should include title,
%     abstract, introduction, related work, one or more technical sections, one
%     section about empirical analysis, conclusion, and references.

%     4. Does the report contain plagiarism content?

%     5. Is the proposed AI algorithms and/or models described in sufficient detail?

%     6. What is an overall evaluation of the presentation?

%     7. Is there a clear description about the feature extraction process? Are
%     the features clearly described?

% % }}}

% 3. Technical content (50%): {{{

%     1. Does the implementation code include plagiarism content?

%     2. Is the code uploaded?

%     3. Is there any exploratory data analysis?

%     4. Are the research problem and the main tasks clearly described? The
%     students in one team should focus on separate tasks. If some students
%     focused on the same tasks, the differences of their contributions should be
%     described clearly.

%     5. What is the overall level of efforts for the main tasks. Each report
%     should clearly describe which parts of the code were written by the author.
%     The load of coding can be measured by the the time that is required to
%     implement and debug the code. This time will be estimated by the instructor
%     and TA based on an overall evaluation of the code.  If the load of coding is
%     too low (e.g., 2 hours), the level of efforts will be low (e.g, 0.2). If the
%     load of coding is high (e.g., 50 hours), the level of efforts will be high
%     (e.g., 0.9).

%     6. What is the level of originality and creativity about the proposed work?

%         Examples of high originality and creativity are: (1) The proposed work
%         replicates the results of an existing paper and conducts some new
%         empirical analysis not reported in the paper, such as empirical analysis
%         based on new evaluation metrics (e.g., area under curve, area under
%         precision-recall curve) and new datasets not considered in the paper.
%         (2) The proposed work conducts an empirical comparison between the
%         methods proposed in several different papers. (3) The proposed work
%         develops new algorithms or new neural network architectures and
%         demonstrates the effectiveness and/or efficiency of the proposed
%         techniques, in comparison with some baseline methods in real-world
%         datasets. Algorithms and neural network architectures modified from
%         existing ones are also considered as new. (4) The proposed work presents
%         novel applications of AI models that have not been studied in the
%         current literature. (5) The proposed work develops new algorithms and/or
%         models for Kaggle competitions and demonstrates the effectiveness and/or
%         efficiency of the proposed techniques on the kaggle datasets, in
%         comparison with some baseline methods.

%         Examples of low/medium originality and creativity: (1) The proposed work
%         only replicates the results of an existing paper but does not conduct
%         any new empirical analysis. (2) The proposed work implements classic AI
%         models (e.g., logistic regression, linear regression, bayesian neural
%         networks, support vector machines) for classic problems (e.g.,
%         classification, regression) on some benchmark datasets.

% 7. Is there a detailed discussion about how the hyper parameters were turned?
% Have the finalized hyperparameters of all the AI models been reported?

% 8. Are the empirical results discussed in sufficient detail?
